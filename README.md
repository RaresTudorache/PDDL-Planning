This assignment is about planning using the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL).

Part 1 - A written exercise in which we will formalize a planning problem using PDDL

Part 2 - Implementing and verifying the correctness of our written model using a browser-based
PDDL planner

Part 3 - Extending the model to deal with additional features (and constraints) in the environment

Part 4 - A discussion of how one would address yet another, much more complex, theoretical
extension to the planning problem, which we have deliberately designed to test the limit of what
can be done in PDDL
